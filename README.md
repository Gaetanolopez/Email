This code defines an Email class that has two attributes: has_been_read and is_spam.
These attributes are initially set to False. The class has three methods: mark_as_read, mark_as_spam, and str. 
The first two methods change the values of the attributes to True.
The str method is used to display the contents of an email object in a string format when it is printed.
There are also several functions defined outside the class that interact with instances of the class. 
The add_email function creates a new email object and appends it to a list called inbox.
The get_count function prints the number of emails in the inbox. 
The get_email function allows the user to select an email by index, marks it as read, and prints the email's contents. 
The get_unread_emails function prints all emails that have not been read yet.
The get_spam_emails function prints all emails that have been marked as spam.
The delete function allows the user to delete an email by index.
Finally, there is a while loop that prompts the user to perform different actions using the functions defined above.
The loop continues until the user types "quit".
